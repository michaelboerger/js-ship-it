<p id="message_begin">I SURE WISH I FIGURED OUT SOME OF THIS STUFF EARLIER.<br />
  HERE COMES TROUBLE<br /><br />
  Type help to get help(if you need help)</p>

<p id="message_help">NO!<br />
<br />
Just kidding! I'll totally help. Type you choice number and hope really hard that I programmed something to happen when you do that.</p>

<p id="area_late">You are on your way to start your Launch Academy Quest but you are late!<br /><br />
            Your poor time management will surely upset Dan!<br /><br />
            Dan is a morning person and doesn't have the patience for your shenanigans.<br /><br />
            1. Slow and steady wins the race<br />
            2. Attempt to use a rocket ship<br />
            3. Attempt to use a Time Portal<br />
            CHOOSE YOUR CHOICE! </p>

<p id="message_1">You attempt model your life off of allegorical turtles.<br />
            Slowing down doesn't speed you up!<br />
            WHY WOULD IT HAVE???<br /></p>

<p id="message_2">
  You have to graduate from Launch Academy before getting rocket launching abilities.<br /><br />
  NOTE, IF YOU SAID: 'Actually, I have grauated from Launch Academy!'<br /><br />
  Well, good job by you. <br />
  Please stop trying to ruin my games immersion.<br /></p>

<p id="message_3">
You attempt to use a time portal, unfortunately in your haste you use a thyme portal.<br />
You get a sprig of thyme!<br /><br />
You are late but your thyme has put a... haha... SPRIG in your step (get it?)<br /><br />
            You're still late though so figure something out.<br /><br />
            1. Slow and steady wins the race<br />
            4. Attempt to use a rocket SPRIG<br />
            5. Move on and hope no one notices!<br />
            CHOOSE YOUR CHOICE!

<p id="message_4">Oh man these are getting awful, I'm sorry.<br /></p>

<p id="message_5">EVERYONE NOTICED<br /><br />
            THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS TO STOP BEING LATE<br /><br />
            Or, alternatively<br />
            Thyme doesn't pay</p>
